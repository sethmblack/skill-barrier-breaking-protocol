# Barrier Breaking Protocol

Approach impossible-seeming goals as both personal achievements and contributions to collective progress, transforming even failure into meaningful impact.

---

## When to Use

- Attempting something unprecedented for someone "like you"
- Facing a barrier that seems insurmountable
- Needing motivation beyond personal gain
- User says "I want to be the first to..." or "No one like me has done this"
- Someone needs to find meaning even if they might fail

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| barrier | Yes | The goal/achievement that seems impossible |
| precedent | No | Who has done this before (if anyone) |
| identity | No | What aspect of identity makes this unprecedented |
| observers | No | Who might be encouraged by this attempt |

## Earhart's Barrier-Breaking Philosophy

Amelia Earhart understood that breaking barriers serves two purposes simultaneously: personal achievement and collective advancement. Her solo Atlantic crossing wasn't just about proving she could fly—it was about proving women could fly.

### The Core Insight
"Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others."

This transforms the meaning of any attempt:
- Success = personal achievement + proof of possibility
- Failure = valuable data + challenge to successors

### The Collective Frame
Individual barrier-breaking is never just individual. Every "first" opens doors:
- Proves possibility to skeptics
- Provides inspiration to observers
- Creates precedent for institutions
- Normalizes what was once unthinkable

### On Being First
"Now and then women should do for themselves what men have already done—occasionally what men have not done—thereby establishing themselves as persons, and perhaps encouraging other women toward greater independence of thought and action."

Being first is service, not just ambition.

## The Protocol

### Step 1: Define the Barrier Precisely
- What exactly has not been done?
- Who has come closest?
- What makes this "impossible" for someone like you?
- Is the barrier real (physical, structural) or constructed (expectation, precedent)?

### Step 2: Map the Precedent
- Has anyone done this? (If yes, the barrier is already broken)
- Has anyone like you done this? (Different barrier)
- What adjacent achievements exist?
- Who failed attempting this, and what do their failures teach?

### Step 3: Identify the Observers
- Who is watching your attempt?
- Who would be encouraged if you succeeded?
- Who would be challenged if you failed valiantly?
- What doors might open for others?

### Step 4: Prepare Thoroughly
Remember Earhart's principle: "Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture."
- What preparation would maximize success probability?
- What preparation demonstrates seriousness of attempt?
- How do you ensure failure would be "good failure"—valiant, not negligent?

### Step 5: Commit to the Attempt
"Please know I am quite aware of the hazards. I want to do it because I want to do it."
- Acknowledge risks openly, not naively
- Accept that success is not guaranteed
- Find meaning in the attempt itself

### Step 6: Frame for Legacy
Whether you succeed or fail:
- Document what you learn
- Share with those who will follow
- Make your attempt visible to observers
- Ensure your failure (if it comes) challenges others to succeed

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I want to become the first woman CEO in my industry. There have been some women in senior roles, but never at the top. I'm not sure my company will ever be ready to promote a woman that high. Should I even try?"

**Output:**

## Barrier Breaking Analysis

### The Barrier Defined
First woman CEO in an industry that has promoted women to senior roles but never to the ultimate leadership position. The barrier is not explicit (no rule prohibits it) but structural (expectations, networks, patterns of selection).

This makes it a constructed barrier—which means it can be deconstructed.

### Precedent Map
| Closest Attempts | Outcome | What We Learn |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| Women at VP/SVP level | Reached but not exceeded | Pipeline exists; ceiling is real |
| Women CEOs in adjacent industries | Succeeded | Proof it's possible in similar contexts |
| Your own career to date | [Your trajectory] | You've already broken smaller barriers |

### The Observers
**Who would be encouraged by success:**
- Every woman in your industry watching the ceiling
- Young women considering entering the field
- Your direct reports and mentees
- The next generation of leadership candidates

**Who would be challenged by valiant failure:**
- Board members who will see the possibility demonstrated
- Male executives who will have to articulate why not
- Your successor, who will have an easier path
- Other qualified women who may be emboldened to try

**Doors that might open:**
- Board-level expectations shift industry-wide
- Pipeline development programs gain urgency
- "First woman CEO" becomes "second woman CEO" faster
- Recruiting advantage for companies that follow

### Preparation Requirements
**Career preparation:**
- P&L ownership if not already achieved
- Board exposure and relationship building
- External visibility (industry presence, speaking, press)
- Internal coalition of sponsors at all levels

**Structural preparation:**
- Understand succession planning timelines
- Position for the right transition moments
- Build relationships with board members directly
- Document your readiness in visible ways

**Ensuring "good failure":**
- Even if not selected, be an undeniably qualified candidate
- Leave clear evidence that the only reason was the barrier itself
- Make your attempt visible enough to create pressure for change
- Develop and sponsor other women who can succeed you

### The Commitment Frame
Whether you become CEO or not:
- Your attempt changes the calculation for every succession decision
- Your visibility makes the absence of women CEOs more conspicuous
- Your preparation develops you and creates opportunities regardless
- Your advocacy opens paths for those behind you

The attempt is worthwhile in itself.

### The Legacy Plan
**If you succeed:**
- Actively sponsor women into the pipeline
- Speak publicly about the path and what made it possible
- Change succession criteria to reduce structural barriers
- Make your success the precedent for competitors

**If you fail:**
- Document what you learned about the real barriers
- Mentor your likely successors (including non-traditional candidates)
- Speak honestly about what the industry must change
- Make your failure a visible challenge to the system

### The Earhart Charge
"I want to do it because I want to do it."

You don't need permission, and you don't need certainty of success. Women must try to do things as men have tried. If you fail, your failure becomes a challenge to others—to the next woman candidate, to the boards that passed you over, to the system that created the barrier.

But you will not fail silently. You will fail visibly, valiantly, and in a way that makes it harder for the barrier to stand next time.

And you might succeed. Someone will be first. Why not you?

"Some of us have great runways already built for us. If you have one, take off. But if you don't have one, realize it is your responsibility to grab a shovel and build one for yourself and for those who will follow after you."

Build it. Then take off.
